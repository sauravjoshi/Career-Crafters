# Career-Crafters

# **Project Introduction**

## **Overview**
In today's competitive job market, indiscriminately applying to every available job posting is not only futile but also inefficient. A more strategic approach involves identifying job opportunities that align with an individual's specific skill set, thereby increasing the chances of the resume being shortlisted by Application Tracking Systems (ATS). This project aims to address this challenge by developing a recommender system that matches job seekers with the most relevant job postings based on their resumes.

## **Project Goals**
- **Objective**: To build a recommender system that informs job seekers of the best job opportunities aligned with their skills and experiences.
- **Target**: Enhance job application effectiveness by ensuring resumes are matched with suitable job postings, potentially increasing interview chances.
