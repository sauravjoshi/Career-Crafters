\textbf{KEYWORDS:} Job Matching, Machine Learning, Recommendation Systems, Data Preprocessing, Natural Language Processing, Interactive Web Application.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

In todayâ€™s job market, finding the right job is often as challenging as getting the job itself. While existing job search tools focus on indicating how well a candidate's qualifications match a job listing, they fall short in actively guiding users to their best matches. Career Crafters addresses this gap by offering a more proactive solution. Our system uses advanced machine learning to analyze job postings and candidate resumes, ensuring that job seekers get recommendations that are not just close matches but the best possible options for their skills and experiences. This report will discuss how Career Crafters was built, from initial data handling to the deployment of personalized job recommendations, highlighting its advantages in helping candidates efficiently find suitable jobs.

% \subsection{Secondary Heading or Sub-headings}

% Here we have a sub-heading. There is no blank line after the sub-heading. You can have one level of subheadings but not a third i.e. you cannot have Section 1.1.1 as a subheading.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item If you want to list bullet points you can do so;
%     \item This is the second point;
%     \item This is a third bullet point;
%     \item A fourth bullet point;
%     \item But you can.
% \end{itemize}   

% After a list you must leave a single blank line and remember to add the indent if you are starting a new paragraph.

% \subsection{Another sub-heading}

% You can have as many sub-headings in a section as you want to. Note that sub-headings have a 6pt spacing after them rather than a blank line but they are preceded by a blank line. The number of sections and sub-sections is up to you, as are the titles of each of them and this will be driven by the content of your report.

\section{DATA Processing}

\subsection{Data Collection}

    \subsubsection{Data Description}
    The Career Crafters application utilizes a comprehensive dataset of 32641 job postings, which were sourced from Kaggle and then merged to form a consolidated database suitable for analysis. The data comprises 11 attributes such as Job Title, Company Name, Job Location, and more, all of which are essential for developing accurate job recommendations.

    \subsubsection{Data Acquisition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Master Data:} The data was acquired from Kaggle from different sources and merged based on relevant features to create a master set. \hyperlink{https://drive.google.com/file/d/12r3pCPnpawmdEmWB34k7UO1IjS2t4o34/view?usp=sharing}{https://drive.google.com/file/d/12r3pCPnpawmdEmWB34k7UO1IjS2t4o34/view?usp=sharing}
        \item \textbf{Software Engineer:} \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/software-engineer-job-postings-linkedin}{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/software-engineer-job-postings-linkedin}
        \item \textbf{Data Engineer:} \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/linkedin-data-engineer-job-postings}{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/linkedin-data-engineer-job-postings}
        \item \textbf{Data Analyst:} \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-analyst-job-postings}{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-analyst-job-postings}
        \item \textbf{Data Scientist:} \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-scientist-linkedin-job-postings}{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/data-scientist-linkedin-job-postings}
    \end{itemize}

    
    \subsubsection{Column Types and Data Characteristics}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item job\_title, company, job\_location, job\_link, first\_seen, search\_city, search\_country, job level, job\_type, job\_summary, job\_skills: All of these columns were string value. 
        \item First Seen: This column is Datetime, indicating when the job was first posted or collected.
        \item Derived Numerical Data: Post-processing, geo-coordinates were derived from the 'job\_location' text to facilitate spatial analysis.
    \end{itemize}   

\subsection{Data Wrangling}
    \subsubsection{Cleaning and Pre-Processing}
    Initial data cleaning involved string and list handling, where all attributes were cleansed to remove irrelevant characters and spaces ensuring clean and usable text for analysis. Specifically, the `job\_summary` and `job\_skills` attributes, which had 411 and 1273 NA entries respectively, were removed to maintain the integrity of the dataset as imputing them or deriving them was not feasible.

    \subsubsection{Irregularities Handling}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item  Since the source data was scraped from LinkedIn, it was free-flow data. There were irregularities present in the job\_title such as Sr. Data Engineer and Senior Data Engineer is effectively the same. Also for the job title Senior Data Engineer, Public Company and Senior Data Engineer are effectively the same. 
        \item Also the job\_locations were not in a set format. This feature was also important to us for geospatial analysis of job distribution. There were some job postings without proper addressing. Also since we had data from countries such as the UK, Australia, and Canada, this made having a uniform format even more difficult.
        \item  Custom scripts were written specifically for these tasks that cater to the variance in these data and extract relevant information.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Text Preprocessing (done over job\_skills\_summary)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Tokenization and Normalization:} Job descriptions and skills were broken down into tokens and normalized to lowercase to standardize the data.
        \item \textbf{Stop Words Removal:} Common stop words were removed to emphasize more significant terms relevant to job skills.
        \item \textbf{Punctuation Handling:} Punctuation marks were removed as they can interfere with text processing tasks like vectorization.
        \item \textbf{Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:} Words were tagged according to their parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). We extracted clean POS from the initially tagged POS token by removing tokens with only 1 character. This gives us the final cleaned token. Certain specific tokens are also removed such as "company", "description", "title", "job", and "skills", as these are junk for a job\_description field. 
        \item \textbf{Lemmatization:} Words were reduced to their base form, aiding in uniformity and effectiveness in matching processes. Finally, lemmatization is done over the cleaned token which are joined back to form the final processed job\_description string.
        \item \textbf{Vectorization:} Finally, the text was converted into a numeric format using vectorization techniques to feed textual data into machine learning algorithms.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Feature Engineering}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Geo Code Retrieval:} After handling the irregularities as described above, once standardized, geo-coordinates for each job posting were retrieved. This enabled precise geospatial analysis of job distribution, facilitating insights into regional employment trends and opportunities.
        \item \textbf{Interpolating job\_skills to job\_desc:} To consolidate and enhance the information available for our recommendation model, 'job\_skills' were combined with 'job\_summary' to create a new column called 'job\_skills\_summary'. This column integrates all critical skill-related information with the job descriptions, providing a unified data point that enhances the effectiveness of our job matching algorithms by ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
    \end{itemize}

    \caption{Results (note that figure captions go BELOW THE FIGURE)}
    \label{fig_results}
    \end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Total 7 Resumes considered for checking efficacy amongst top 5 recommendations for each embedding using K-NN.

    \item  Relevant Skills and Relevant Titles are matched using a Fuzzy String matching.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Skills with a partial\_ratio of greater than 80\%.
    	\item Titles with a partial\_ratio of greater than 90\%.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Embedding Techniques Comparison}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A comparison of embedding techniques revealed that GloVe outperformed others with an 80\% match for relevant skills and an 85.71\% match for job titles. This high performance indicates a strong alignment between the job recommendations provided by the system and the candidates' profiles and preferences.

 \item Word2Vec also showed promising results, especially in matching relevant job titles with a match percentage of 82.85\%, indicating its effectiveness in capturing the context of job descriptions and titles .
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis of Recommendation System}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The system was tested with a set of 7 resumes, evaluating the top 5 recommendations for each resume against various embeddings using the K-NN algorithm. This practical approach to testing helped fine-tune the recommendation engine for precision.

 \item The relevance of the matches was determined using a fuzzy string matching algorithm, with a partial ratio threshold set to ensure only the most appropriate recommendations were considered successful. Skills and titles meeting these criteria underscore the tailored nature of the job matching process.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interactive Web Application}

A key outcome of the project is an interactive web application that showcases the recommendation engine in real-time operation. This user-friendly interface allows job seekers to experience firsthand the sophistication of the recommendation system. Through the web application, users can submit their resumes and instantly receive job recommendations.

The web application's front end is built using React with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and integrates react-plotly for dynamic data visualization. The back end is developed in Python using the Flask framework, with vector models for the recommendation engine stored in files to facilitate quick and efficient data processing.
